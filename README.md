/task/ spam email classifier 

PROJECT TITLE: SPAM EMAIL CLASSIFIER
Project Description – A simple machine learning model that can classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). 
Steps –
1. Data Collection- Collected a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham from dataset on Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing- Cleaned and preprocessing of email data. Like removing special characters, lowercasing, tokenization and removing stop words.
3. Feature extraction- Text data is converted to numerical feature using Count Vectorization
4. Label Encoding- Encoded (ham/spam) email as binary labels(1 for spam, 0 for ham).
5. Model Selection- I have used Naïve Bayes as a machine learning algorithm for binary classification. 
6. Data Split- Dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing of data.
7. Model Evaluation- Evaluation of model performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision.
